# Single Cell

## Computational models

- [Hodgkin-Huxley model](HH/hh_spiker.ipynb)
- Detailed model of an L5 cortical neuron (TBA)
- Equivalent model of an L5 cortical neuron with reduced morphology (TBA)

## Principles of single cell modeling and tuning
- [Tutorials on single cell properties](https://cyneuro.github.io/cyneuro-resources/training/comp_neuro_tutorials.html#content-training-comp-neuro-tutorials)
- Guidelines for manual tuning of channel conductances (TBA on ACT publication)
- Guidelines for manual tuning of synapses and synaptic inputs
- Guidelines for building equivalent cells with reduced morphology

## Automated tuning
- Automatic cell tuner (TBA on ACT publication)

## Packages
We use the following packages for single cell modeling:
- [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) (also see [MIT NEURON tutorial](https://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/index.html))
- [BMTK](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/)

## Datasets
- [CRCNS: hc-3](https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-3/about-hc-3). Spike recordings from the rat hippocampal areas.
- [Buzsaki lab datasets](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/GirardeauG/Rat08/). Spike and LFP recordings from rodents.
- [The DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org). Various neurophysiology recordings.
